# ThreeJS WebGL Starter

A minimal starter setup for building 3D scenes with Three.js **WebGL** based on [Bruno Simon's ThreeJS Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/).

## Perfomance Notes

**Frames rendered in the last second**
This is how many images your computer managed to draw on the screen in one second.

- Higher = smoother motion
- Around **60** is what most screens aim for
- Low numbers = choppy, stuttery visuals

**Milliseconds needed to render a frame**
This is how long it takes to draw **one** of those images.

- Lower = faster and smoother
- About **16 ms per frame** ≈ 60 frames per second
- If this number goes up, performance goes down

**MBytes of allocated memory**
This is how much RAM the page/app is using.

- More memory = heavier load on your system
- Too much can slow things down or cause crashes
- Chrome needs that `--enable-precise-memory-info` flag to show accurate numbers instead of rough guesses

**TLDR:**

- High FPS + low milliseconds = good performance
- Low FPS + high milliseconds = something is struggling
- Memory keeps climbing = possible memory leak or inefficient code

|    10 | L3 (left stick press)                    |
|    11 | R3 (right stick press)                   |
|    12 | D-Pad Up                                 |
|    13 | D-Pad Down                               |
|    14 | D-Pad Left                               |
|    15 | D-Pad Right                              |
|    16 | PS (PlayStation button)                  |
|    17 | Touchpad press (DualShock 4 / DualSense) |

### Axes (gamepad.axes[index])

| Index | Control                           |
| ----: | --------------------------------- |
|     0 | Left stick X (-1 left → +1 right) |
|     1 | Left stick Y (-1 up → +1 down)    |
|     2 | Right stick X                     |
|     3 | Right stick Y                     |

## ECS

- **Entities** = IDs
- **Components** = data only
- **Systems** = logic that operates on entities with certain components

### Why:

It kills god-objects, scales cleanly, is faster, easier to refactor, and makes features like AI, multiplayer, and replays manageable instead of painful. **ECS keeps complexity under control as projects grow.**
